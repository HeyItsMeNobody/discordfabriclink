# Discord-Fabric link
Made possible by dzwdz <3

Discord-Fabric link is a mod that links your Minecraft chat and a Discord channel together.

There are multiple other mods like this, but what makes this one special, is that it uses **Discord webhooks** to send player messages, which will display their profile picture and name.
